			 <p>A lot of software - perhaps the majority of software - is written in the wrong language because “what language is the developer most familiar with” was a more important consideration than “what language is best for this project”.</p>

			 <p>I was quite excited to see Settlers 2 is getting an Amiga port. Then I saw the minimum specs required are higher than any Amiga that ever shipped! So who is this for, running only on Franken-Amigas, FPGAs and emulators? A500/A1200 port please. <a href="https://lookbehindyou.de/en/product/thesettlers2amiga/">lookbehindyou.de/en/produc&hellip;</a></p>

			 <p>You should never buy from John Lewis. Their behaviour is so egregiously bad no amount of 1 star reviews would cover it, yet it doesn’t get reported in the press so most are unaware. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1p42jzw/update_john_lewis_ipad_non_delivery_claim_england/">old.reddit.com/r/LegalAd&hellip;</a></p>

			 <p>Apparently the Steam Frame VR headset will have perfect x86 emulation on ARM. That’s cool; it means the next Steam Deck could be ARM and so be cheaper/faster/lighter. But what about if a dev wants to avoid the emulation, can they ship native binaries? <a href="https://www.igalia.com/2025/11/helpingvalve.html">www.igalia.com/2025/11/h&hellip;</a></p>

			 <p>Has anyone managed to get a subscription to Cerebras? They keep announcing but seem to be permanently “sold out”.  <a href="https://www.cerebras.ai/blog/glm">www.cerebras.ai/blog/glm</a> The theory seems to be it isn’t as good as Claude but makes up for it by being faster?</p>

			 <p>Login to website</p>
<ol>
<li>Find email address. I usually use unique addresses so this should be enough to identify me?</li>
<li>Remember my cookies? No it never remembers me.</li>
<li>Verify email. Wait for it to come through. Annoying</li>
<li>Verify phone number. What if it lost my phone?</li>
<li>Enter TOTP code. Quick, before it disappears! Again, what if lost phone?</li>
</ol>
<p>Why can’t we just have one digital identify that handles all this?</p>
